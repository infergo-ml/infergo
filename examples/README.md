# Basic examples of infergo 

 * [hello](hello/) — probabilistic "hello world" — inferring parameters of a normal distribution.
 * [gmm](gmm/) — simple Gaussian mixture model. See [infergo case studies](http://bitbucket.org/dtolpin/infergo-studies) for a more elaborated model.
 * [adapt](adapt/) — NUTS adaptation on the Gaussian mixture model.
 * [schools](school/) - the 8 schools problem.
 * [ppv](ppv/) — inferring pages-per-visit based on a vector of Beta-Bernoulli processes.
