// Automatic differentiation of a model
package ad

// A model is defined in it's own package. The model must
// implement interface model.Model. In the model's source code:
//   1. Method Observe of interface model.Model is
//      differentiated.
//   2. All methods on the type implementing model.Model
//      are differentiated.
//   3. Within the methods, the following is differentiated:
//      a) assignments to float64;
//      b) returns of float64;
//      c) standalone calls to methods on the type implementing
//         model.Model (apparently called for side  effects on
//         the model).
//
// Functions are considered elementals (and must have a
// registered derivative):
//   a) if they are defined in a different package, and
//   b) their signature is of kind 
//                  func (float64, ...float64) float64
//      that is, at least one float64 argument and float64 return
//      value. For example, function
//                  func (float64, float64, float64) float64
//      is considered elemental, while functions
//                  func ([]float64) float64
//                  func (int, float64) float64
//      are not.
//  
// Derivatives do not propagate through a function that is not
// an elemental or a call to a model method. If a derivative is
// not registered for an elemental, calling the elemental in a
// differentiated context will cause a run-time error.
//
// The differentiated model is put into subpackage 'ad'
// of the model's package.
